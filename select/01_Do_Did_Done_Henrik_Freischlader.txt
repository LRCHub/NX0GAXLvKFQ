I am close to myself but I'm going far
I got a long long road but a broken car
Some people might think that I am a star
But there ain't no cutting the dash
Without taking along the scars

'Cause when it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done

I don't have a cellphone
I've got three of them
I get four hundred emails a day
Spend the night answering
My two hours of sleep
Get cut off of by the postman
Waking up with my clothes on
And the letters in my hands

'Cause when it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done

When it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done
Yeah

But it feels so good, you know
That I never would change it into manic regulation
But I know I should praise the Lord
And knock on wood
'Cause every time my job is done
I'm already on the run

I keep all my guitars in the bus
'Cause I'm playing two shows a day
Sometimes I might hear you talk
But I don't know what you say
My dreams tell scenes that mean
Hollywood goes green with envy
Yeah

But I like it tough, hard an rough
Not chumming up mercenary

When it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done

When it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done

When it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done

When it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done

When it's far too much
It's not enough
When you feel it all it starts to touch
But I'm holding on to going strong
When you do all you did is done
